# PUMS_PersonWeight
This repository is all about deriving actionable insights from American Community Survey (ACS) data by employing their use of person weights. 
ACS is a survey of roughly 3.5 million addresses nation-wide, and it uses past data and decennial census data to make predictions about the probability of population shares for socioeconomic and demographic characteristics. 
It uses "weights" to scale up the size of those shares to fit the overall population of the U.S.! 
Analysis of ACS data without these weights is useless so this repository is all about understanding how to use them. (Btw there are also household wieghts for household-level data but we'll get to those another time)\

My code is a work in progress but it's a good start to get you working with ACS.
